# Solitary Meme TD (SMTD)

> "When you have SMTD (So Much To Do), play SMTD (Solitary Meme TD)."

Solitary Meme TD (SMTD) is a semi-idle, meme-fueled tower defense game built for degen gamers and busy professionals alike. It fits into your life, not takes it over — letting you strategically upgrade, earn, and compete at your own pace.

## Concept

If you love gaming — but life gets in the way. That's where SMTD comes in.

SMTD blends:

- Pixelated, minimalist fantasy art
- Effortless progression with idle gameplay
- Competitive depth via multiplayer staking rounds
- Ownership through tradable NFTs and token-based upgrades

## Problem Statement

- Busy users lack time for traditional games.

  - SMTD lets players progress with minimal attention.

- Lack of progression and ownership in web3 games.
  - SMTD offers token-based infinite upgrades and NFTs that evolve with you.

## Features

- 🧱 Real-time browser gameplay (Three.js + React)
- 🪙 Dual-currency economy:
  - Coins – Earned in-game for temporary upgrades
  - Shards (SMTD) – Purchased/staked for permanent upgrades, tower evolution, loot boxes
- 🧩 Towers as NFTs – Tradable, upgradeable, ownable
- 🥇 Multiplayer staking – Challenge others, win real rewards
- 🌐 On-chain logic powered by Solana – Efficient and scalable for smooth Web3 gaming
- 🎨 Meme IP x Pixel art – Built for virality and vibe

## 💸 Business Model

- Token Sales – Players fast-forward with Shards
- NFT Royalties – 5% fee on tower trades
- Multiplayer Staking Fee – Platform takes a 5% cut from the pot
